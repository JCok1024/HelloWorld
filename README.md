# HelloWorld
<h3>This is my first code repository. </h3>
<p>I come from China.You can call me <em>JC</em> or <em>SeaRock(mean '海石' in English)</em>.</p>
<p>This is my first code in GitHub. I'm a totally noob and beginner.
<p>Thus, I'm trying hard to learn English and Javascript so that I can communicate with you all.</p>
<p>Update at 2017 Mar 17. With half a year coding, my JavaScript has grown up a litle, but English still bad xD. </p>
<h3>Thank you all.</h3>
